          thank you dellulli for being the best poop bestie i could ask for. i’ve never had an online friend as long as you or as close as we are, but im very happy and grateful that i do now. you’re hilarious and most of the time when we talk im either smiling or laughing. which also makes the time fly by so fast every night we hangout. night time is my favorite, but it’s really only good when i have you to hangout with. you kinda just make me happier in general, there’s been lots of times i’ve been upset about irl stuff or stressed and whenever we talk i js forget all about it. we can talk about anything and start a conversation from anything, whether it’s serious or just trolling. im just genuinely really appreciative to have someone like you in my life. you’re a great person dellulli i hope yk that, you’re special at least to me. i don’t think i would be able to have another friendship like ours cause nobody is like you, they wouldn’t reply like u or be funny and that would just pmo cause i can’t carry the conversation the whole time. so i think we balance each other out pretty well imo. i hope you’re able to have a good birthday, if you lived with the papals we would make sure to spoil you, but since you’re so far this is the least i can do
